# Myoelectric Prosthetic Arm v1 (EMG Controlled)

A low-cost 3D printed prosthetic arm controlled using muscle signals (EMG).

## Features
- Muscle signal based finger control
- Arduino based processing
- Bluetooth configuration
- Affordable and repairable design

## Hardware Used
- Arduino Uno
- EMG Muscle Sensor
- MG996R Servos
- PCA9685 Driver
- HC-05 Bluetooth
- 3D Printed Mechanical Parts

## Working Principle
Muscle contraction generates EMG signal → Arduino reads analog value → threshold detection → servo movement.
